            NIIT Limited is an Indian multinational skills and talent development corporation headquartered in Gurgaon,
            India. The company was set up in 1981 to help the nascent IT industry overcome its human resource
            challenges. NIIT offers training and development to individuals, enterprises and institutions.

            NIIT was established in 1981 by Rajendra S. Pawar and Vijay K. Thadani, graduates from IIT[4] Delhi, with
            one million rupees. NIIT conceived a franchising model in IT education for the very first time, setting up
            nine centers by 1987.

            In 1986, NIIT began its foray into the software domain, beginning with Software Product Distribution under
            the 'Insoft' brand.[5] The company also began offering advice and consultancy to large corporations on how
            to leverage technology and make optimum use of their IT investments.
